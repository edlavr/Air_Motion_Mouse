# Air Motion Mouse

A hackathon project that uses Leap Motion to control mouse


### Update: Our project has achieved top-6 on DurHack, as well as won in a nomination 'Best use of tech' by Bloomberg!


## Project Description:

For this year’s Durhack challenge, we were asked to create something related to the topic “Changing Human Computer Interactions”. Our team did a virtual mouse for a computer using the Leap Motion sensor. It can carry out various functions such as: move mouse, Click, scroll up and down, move cursor between texts, halt all mouse movements, and an enter function.
