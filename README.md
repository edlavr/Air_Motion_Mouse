Project Description:
	For this year’s Durhack challenge, we were asked to create something related to the topic “Changing Human Computer Interactions”. Our team did a virtual mouse for a computer using the Leap Motion sensor. It can carry out various functions such as: move mouse, Click, scroll up and down, move cursor between texts, halt all mouse movements, and an enter function.
